                <h1>About Aaron</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my digital realm! I'm Aaron, a web developer and IT enthusiast based in the South West, UK. I recently achieved a Distinction in my IT apprenticeship, solidifying my expertise in a variety of programming languages and technologies.</p>

                <p>My professional journey in IT spans several years, with a focus on web development. I primarily work with JavaScript and NodeJS, but I'm also skilled in C/C++, Python, and Java. I have a growing interest in Deno, aiming to incorporate it into my personal projects.</p>

                <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in the worlds of gaming, sci-fi, and exploring the vast universe through the lens of physics, astrophysics, and astrobiology. My curiosity also extends to quantum mechanics and philosophy, fueling endless intellectual exploration.</p>

                <p>As a visual learner, I prefer to see concepts come to life through code and practical examples. This approach not only aids my understanding but also drives my passion for sharing knowledge with others. Research and continual learning form the bedrock of my professional and personal growth.</p>

                <p>My personal philosophy is grounded in atheism and a left-wing political stance. I believe in the power of technology, particularly AI, as a natural extension of evolution, with the potential to unlock profound insights into our universe, consciousness, and more.</p>

                <p>Thank you for visiting my site. I hope to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to meaningful technological advancements.</p>
